	    <p>If you would like me to write you a recommendation letter for anything such as REUs (which you can find a list of <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/list_result.jsp?unitid=5044" target="_blank">here</a>), graduate school, or anything else, please ask me at least <b>one month</b> in advance and <b>tell me your soonest deadline</b>. In rare emergencies, I may agree to write a letter two weeks in advance. </p>
	
	<p>In order to write a recommendation letter for you, please email me the following information at least <b>two weeks</b> before the deadline:
		<ol>
			<li> What is your name, year, and major?</li>
			<li>For what are you applying and what is the earliest deadline? (scholarship, internship, graduate school, etc.)</li>
			<li>If applying to multiple programs, list the programs to which you are applying, together with due dates and how recommendations will be submitted (many programs automatically generate an email with a link for submission, but others might require me to send an email by the deadline).</li>
			<li>How long have I known you, and what is (are) my relationship(s) to you? (instructor, advisor, etc.)</li>
			<li>For what class(es) have I had you, what final grade(s) did I assign you, and how did you distinguish yourself in my class(es)?</li>
			<li> Please choose four adjectives you think describe you well. </li>
			<li> What are some of your academic accomplishments? </li>
			<li> What are some of your nonacademic accomplishments (if any)? </li>
			<li> What makes me particularly qualified to write a letter for you? </li>
			<li> What makes you particularly qualified for this position/honor/award? </li>
			<li> What are your long term goals and, if relevant, how does this position/honor/award fit in? </li>
			<li> Additional comments (REUâ€™s, summer research, interesting jobs, hobbies, etc.)? </li> 
	</ol>
	Please also attach the following documents, preferably as pdfs:
	<ol>
		<li> An unofficial copy of your transcript </li>
		<li> The latest (preferably final) draft of your personal statement (if applicable) </li> 
		<li> The latest version of your resume or CV (if you have one), and </li>
		<li> Any necessary forms and/or login information for the application </li>
	</ol>
	As your deadlines approach, please send me email reminders. This process is to ensure that if I agree to write your letter, it is as strong and detailed as possible. Good luck with your application!
